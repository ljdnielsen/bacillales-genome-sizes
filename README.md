# bacillales-genome-sizes
What is the expected genome size of bacteria of the order Bacillales?

In order to compare the genomes sizes of the assemblies of bioproject PRJNA960711 with that expected for genomes in the order *Bacillales* or family *Bacillaceae* from where most of our isolates are, we generated violin plots from the lengths of reference genomes from those two taxons and all 121 of our assemblies.

# Data Sourcing from NCBI
The data was sourced from [NCBI's genome database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/?bioproject=PRJNA960711) with 'Scientific name', 'Modifier', and Size (Mb) as selected columns before downloading the summary tables for the Bioproject PRJNA960711 genomes, and reference genomes at 'scaffold+' level of the order *Bacillales*, and families *Bacillaceae* and *Paenibacillaceae*.
